## Description

The `nacos` registry interfaces with [Nacos](https://nacos.io/) service discovery, converting service information into `ServiceEntry`. This registry supports the V1 API and the V2 API.

## Configuration

| Name                   | Type                            | Required | Validation        | Description                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| version                | string                          | True     | v1 or v2          | Nacos version                                          |
| serverUrl              | string                          | True     | must be valid URI | Nacos URL                                              |
| namespace              | string                          | False    |                   | Nacos namespace. Default is "public".                  |
| groups                 | string[]                        | False    | min_len = 1       | List of Nacos groups. Default is ["DEFAULT_GROUP"].    |
| serviceRefreshInterval | [Duration](../type.md#duration) | False    | gte: 1s           | Interval for polling the service list. Default is 30s. |

Nacos does not provide an API to subscribe to the current service list, so polling is the only way to retrieve the service list. Configuring a smaller value can allow for quicker detection of service deletions, but will place more pressure on Nacos.

If a domain name is used inside `serverUrl`, it must be an FQDN, such as `svc.cluster.local`, rather than `svc`.

Note: Due to heartbeat intervals, network latencies, and other factors, it may take several seconds for changes in services to affect the `ServiceEntry`. In particular, because of https://github.com/nacos-group/nacos-sdk-go/issues/139, the removal of the last instance in a service will not lead to a change in `ServiceEntry`. Additionally, to prevent `ServiceEntry` from being mistakenly deleted due to polling failures or temporary unavailability of Nacos, the generated `ServiceEntry` will only be cleared when there are changes to the registry configuration.

Note: Since the [nacos-sdk-go](https://github.com/nacos-group/nacos-sdk-go/) writes logs and caches to the file system, and by default, the control plane of HTNN is mounted in read-only mode, it will cause an inability to work with Nacos. The solution is to mount writable directories to `/log` and `/cache` when deploying HTNN. For example, when installing HTNN via helm, you can mount writable directories as follows:

```shell
helm install htnn-controller htnn/htnn-controller ... -f custom-values.yaml
```

Where `custom-values.yaml` contains the following contents:

```yaml
pilot:
  volumes:
  - emptyDir:
      medium: Memory
      # It is configured to retain 10 log files of 1M each, so 20M of space is enough
      sizeLimit: 20Mi
    name: nacos-log
  - emptyDir:
      medium: Memory
      # Depends on the volume of service discovery data
      sizeLimit: 20Mi
    name: nacos-cache
  volumeMounts:
  - name: nacos-log
    mountPath: /log
  - name: nacos-cache
    mountPath: /cache
```

A more ideal solution is to prevent nacos-sdk-go from writing logs and caches to the local file system from the start. After all, in a cloud-native scenario, there is little significance in persisting logs and caches to the local disk. If you find a way to prevent nacos-sdk-go from writing to the file system, you are welcome to update this document.

## Usage

Assuming our Nacos is running at `172.0.0.1:8848`, it can be interfaced with the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: htnn.mosn.io/v1
kind: ServiceRegistry
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  type: nacos
  config:
    serverUrl: http://172.0.0.1:8848
    version: v1
```

For a registered service with a namespace of `public`, group of `prod`, name of `svr`, metadata of `{"type":"server"}`, IP of `192.168.0.1`, and port of 8080, the following configuration will be generated:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: svr.prod.public.default.nacos
spec:
  endpoints:
  - address: 192.168.0.1
    labels:
      type: server
    ports:
      HTTP: 8080
  hosts:
  - svr.prod.public.default.nacos
  location: MESH_INTERNAL
  ports:
  - name: HTTP
    number: 8080
    protocol: HTTP
  resolution: STATIC
```

`hosts` and the `name` of the `ServiceEntry` are consistent, formatted as `$service_name.$nacos_group.$nacos_namespace.$service_registry_name.nacos`. `_` will be converted to `-`, and uppercase letters will be changed to lowercase.

In the generated configuration, `protocol` is HTTP. If it's another protocol, it can be specified in the `protocol` field of the metadata in the registration information. The currently supported protocols are as follows (case-insensitive):

- http
- https
- grpc
- http2
- mongo
- tcp
- tls

In HTTPRoute, we can refer to the generated configuration in `backendRefs`:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: default
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    backendRefs:
    - name: svr.prod.public.default.nacos
      port: 8080
      group: networking.istio.io
      kind: Hostname
```
