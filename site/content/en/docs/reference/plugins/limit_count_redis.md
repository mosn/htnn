title: Limit Count Redis

## Description

The `limitCountRedis` plugin implements a global fixed window rate-limiting by storing the count statistics in Redis. Users can control the number of client accesses within a given time for different dimensions using this plugin.

| statusOnError           | [StatusCode](../../type#statuscode) | False    |                            | The status code used to deny requests when Redis is inaccessible and `failureModeDeny` is true. Defaults to 500.                   |
| rateLimitedStatus       | [StatusCode](../../type#statuscode) | False    |                            | The status code for responses denied due to rate-limiting. Defaults to 429. This setting only takes effect when it's 400 or above. |

Each rule's count is independent. Rate-limiting action is triggered once any rule's quota is exhausted. Responses that are denied due to rate-limiting will include the header `x-envoy-ratelimited: true`. If `enableLimitQuotaHeaders` is set to `true`, all responses will include the following three headers:

* `x-ratelimit-limit`: Represents the applied rate-limiting rule. The format is "the rule with the least remaining quota, (rule quota;w=time window){one or more rules}", e.g., `2, 2;w=60`.
* `x-ratelimit-remaining`: Represents the remaining quota of the rule with the least remaining quota, with a minimum value of `0`.
* `x-ratelimit-reset`: Represents when the rule with the least remaining quota will reset, in seconds, e.g., `59`. Note that due to network latency and other factors, this value is not precise.

### Rule

| Name       | Type                              | Required | Validation | Description                                                                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------|----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| timeWindow | [Duration](../../type#duration)   | True     | >= 1s      | Time window                                                                                   |
| count      | uint32                            | True     | >= 1       | Count                                                                                         |
| key        | string                            | False    |            | The key used for rate limiting. Defaults to client IP. Supports [CEL expressions](../../expr). |

Requests are counted by client IP by default. You can also configure `key` to use other fields. The configuration inside `key` will be interpreted as a CEL expression. For example, `key: request.header("x-key")` means using the request header `x-key` as the dimension for rate limiting. If the value corresponding to `key` is empty, it falls back to counting by client IP.

## Usage

First, let's start a Redis listening on port 6379.
Suppose we provided the following configuration to `http://localhost:10000/`:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: default
    namespace: default
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    backendRefs:
    - name: backend
      port: 8080
---
apiVersion: mosn.io/v1
kind: HTTPFilterPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: default
  filters:
    limitCountRedis:
      config:
        address: "0.0.0.0:6379"
        enableLimitQuotaHeaders: true
        failureModeDeny: true
        rules:
        - count: 2
          timeWindow: "60s"
```

When making requests to the `/echo` path, the first two requests will succeed, and subsequent requests will fail:

```
$ curl http://localhost:10000/echo -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
x-ratelimit-limit: 2, 2;w=60
x-ratelimit-remaining: 1
x-ratelimit-reset: 60
date: Tue, 20 Feb 2024 03:53:01 GMT
...
$ curl http://localhost:10000/echo -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
x-ratelimit-limit: 2, 2;w=60
x-ratelimit-remaining: 0
x-ratelimit-reset: 59
date: Tue, 20 Feb 2024 03:53:02 GMT
...
$ curl http://localhost:10000/echo -i
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
x-envoy-ratelimited: true
x-ratelimit-limit: 2, 2;w=60
x-ratelimit-remaining: 0
x-ratelimit-reset: 58
date: Tue, 20 Feb 2024 03:53:03 GMT
...
```

After one minute, new requests will succeed:

```
$ curl http://localhost:10000/echo -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
x-ratelimit-limit: 2, 2;w=60
x-ratelimit-remaining: 1
x-ratelimit-reset: 60
date: Tue, 20 Feb 2024 03:54:16 GMT
```
