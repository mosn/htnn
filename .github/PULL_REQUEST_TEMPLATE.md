Fix #[issue]

<!--
Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:
* If your change is a bugfix, please add tests which can reproduce the bug.
* If your change is a new feature, please add tests which cover the new functionality, and
update the doc under `site/content/`. You can update one of the doc written in your familiar language.
It's appreciated if you can update both the English and Chinese doc if you know both languages.

If you want to add an E2E test, please add it in `e2e/tests/`.
If you want to add an integration test, please add it in (depending which module you are working on):
* ./api/tests/integration
* ./plugins/tests/integration
* ./controller/tests/integration

You can run the test in the CI by enabling GitHub Action in your own fork and submitting a pull request
to your own fork. Alternatively, you can run the test locally by following the instructions in the CI configuration.

Feel free to ask for help if you need.
