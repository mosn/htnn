# Definition of feature: a feature is a plugin or a registry.
#
# Feature maturity grading rules:
# 1. A feature's maturity level is `experimental` when its implementation is complete.
# 2. A feature is `stable` when it meets both of the following conditions:
#   2.1 It has been in a release version for more than 6 months.
#   2.2 There are no bugfixes on this feature in the last three months.
# 3. If a breaking change occurs or the maintainer thinks it is not stable enough, it returns to `experimental`.
#
# When creating new release, please update the maturity level of the features in this file, according to
# the above rules.
#
# When adding a new feature, please set the experimental_since field to the next release.

plugins:
  # The order here is the same as the order of the plugin execution.
  # This is guaranteed in the CI.
  # TODO: This file only show the plugin's registried order. We should consider a fact that
  # some plugins may not be executed in the DecodeHeaders phase. For example, a plugin called when
  # processing response which is registried in an early place is executed after a plugin called
  # when processing request which is registried in a later place.
